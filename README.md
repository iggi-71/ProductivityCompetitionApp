# ProductivityCompetitionApp
Hello everyone,
The app that I have created is a productivity and competitive app.
My app starts with a login screen prompting a few questions, after that press the login button.
you will see a timer with a fixed 25 minutes, you can press play and pause at your desire.
After competeing the 25 minutes you will recieve 10 points, you can compare with the bots from the app.
Which is located in the Friends Tab, on the Task Tab you will find all your statistics.
Enjoy.
